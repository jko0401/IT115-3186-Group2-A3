Here are some of our favorite Greek myths:

Hercules (known in Greek as Heracles or Herakles) is one of the best-known heroes in Greek and Roman mythology. 
His life was not easy–he endured many trials and completed many daunting tasks–but the reward for his suffering 
was a promise that he would live forever among the gods at Mount Olympus.

Another Greek myth is the myth of Zeus! Zeus was banished by Titans and he and his brothers were divided to rule
the world. He became the god of the sky. He was also known as the father of the gods on Mount Olumpus and men.

The myth of Pan is another. Pan was the god of the wild, who had the legs and horns of a goat. He was laughed at 
by the other gods, so he chose to live alone in the forest where, according to the myth, he played the flute and 
sang in a loud, beautiful voice and chased after nymphs.
