Here are some of our favorite Greek myths:

Hercules (known in Greek as Heracles or Herakles) is one of the best-known heroes in Greek and Roman mythology. 
His life was not easy–he endured many trials and completed many daunting tasks–but the reward for his suffering 
was a promise that he would live forever among the gods at Mount Olympus.

Another Greek myth is the myth of Zeus! Zeus was banished by Titans and he and his brothers were divided to rule
the world. He became the god of the sky. He was also known as the father of the gods on Mount Olumpus and men.

The myth of Pan is another. Pan was the god of the wild, who had the legs and horns of a goat. He was laughed at 
by the other gods, so he chose to live alone in the forest where, according to the myth, he played the flute and 
sang in a loud, beautiful voice and chased after nymphs.

The first human woman, Pandora was Zeus's punishment to mankind because Prometheus stole fire from him to give 
to man. Pandora was given a box as a gift by the gods but was told not to open it. When she disobeyed, all the 
bad things the gods had put in the box - war, poverty, disease, and more - were released into the world. Pandora 
is the reason evil exists in the world.

Ares was the Greek god of war and perhaps the most unpopular of all the Olympian gods because of his quick 
temper, aggressiveness, and unquenchable thirst for conflict. The most popular myth involving Ares was his 
fight with Hercules. Ares’ son Kyknos was infamous for waylaying pilgrims on their way to the oracle at Delphi, 
and so earned the displeasure of Apollo, who sent Hercules to deal with him. Hercules killed Kyknos, and a 
furious Ares engaged the hero in a fight. However, Hercules was protected from harm by Athena and even managed 
to wound Ares.
